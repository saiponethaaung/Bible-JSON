Now his\ngrandfather Jesus, as he himself witnesseth, was a man of great diligence and wisdom among the Hebrews, who did not only gather\nthe grave and short sentences of wise men, that had been before him, but himself also uttered some of his own, full of much\nunderstanding and wisdom. When as therefore the first Jesus died, leaving this book almost perfected, Sirach his son receiving\nit after him left it to his own son Jesus, who, having gotten it into his hands, compiled it all orderly into one volume, and\ncalled it Wisdom, intituling it both by his own name, his father’s name, and his grandfather’s; alluring the hearer by the very\nname of Wisdom to have a greater love to the study of this book. It containeth therefore wise sayings, dark sentences, and\nparables, and certain particular ancient godly stories of men that pleased God; also his prayer and song; moreover, what\nbenefits God had vouchsafed his people, and what plagues he had heaped upon their enemies. This Jesus did imitate Solomon, and\nwas no less famous for wisdom and learning, both being indeed a man of great learning, and so reputed also.\n\\s1 The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach. \n Whereas many and great things have been delivered unto us by the law and the prophets, and by others that have followed\ntheir steps, for the which things Israel ought to be commended for learning and wisdom; and whereof not only the readers must\nneeds become skilful themselves, but also they that desire to learn be able to profit them which are without, both by speaking\nand writing: my grandfather Jesus, when he had much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books\nof our fathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, was drawn on also himself to write something pertaining to learning and\nwisdom; to the intent that those which are desirous to learn, and are addicted to these things, might profit much more in\nliving according to the law. Wherefore let me intreat you to read it with favour and attention, and to pardon us, wherein we\nmay seem to come short of some words, which we have laboured to interpret. For the same things uttered in Hebrew, and\ntranslated into another tongue, have not the same force in them: and not only these things, but the law itself, and the\nprophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and\nthirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Euergetes was king, and continuing there some time, I found a book of no small learning:\ntherefore I thought it most necessary for me to bestow some diligence and travail to interpret it; using great watchfulness and\nskill in that space to bring the book to an end, and set it forth for them also, which in a strange country are willing to\nlearn, being prepared before in manners to live after the law. \n\n"},{"number":1,"text":"All wisdom cometh from the Lord, and is with him for ever. \n\n"},{"number":2,"text":"Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?\n\n"},{"number":3,"text":"Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the deep, and wisdom?\n\n"},{"number":4,"text":"Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.\n\n"},{"number":5,"text":"The word of God most high is the fountain of wisdom;
